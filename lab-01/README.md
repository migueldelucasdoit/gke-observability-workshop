## Prerequisites

* [Terraform 0.13+](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) Tool that manages IaC 
* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) Google Cloud Command Line Interface.
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.
* [Helm 3.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/) Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes.
* [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) Skaffold is a command line tool that facilitates continuous development for container based & Kubernetes applications. It's included as an optional component in Google Cloud SDK and you can install it.

All these tools are available in Google Cloud Cloud Shell which can be [launched](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell) from the Google Cloud console.

## Introduction
You need to deploy the [GKE Observability Blueprints application](./app/README.md) that we will use during our workshop. This demo Application has been built for demonstrating for illustrating monitoring, logging and tracing with GKE. It does have the following components:

* [REST API](./app/api). Presents an external REST-based API for telemetry. Validates the input and publish a message on a Pub/Sub topic.
* [Worker processor](./app/worker) pulls messages from the Pub/Sub topic as they're available. It scales based on the number of acknowledged messages.

## Preparation

* Assignment of the lab users and playgrounds. Make sure you get access to the GCP project that you will use during the workshop.
* Login to the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com) with the required credentials.
* [Activate Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell) from the Google Cloud console.
* Once you've launched your [Cloud Shell Terminal](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/use-cloud-shell-terminal), check that all the required components are installed and up-to-date.
```
gcloud version
helm version
kubectl version --short --client-only
skaffold version
terraform version
```

## Deploy the application

* Set the [*CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT*](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#default_project) environment variable to your GCP project ID.
```
export CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=PROJECT_ID
```

* Set the [default compute region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#set-default-region-zone-environment-variables) environment variable to `europe-west6`.
```
export CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION=europe-west6
```

* Set the [default compute zone](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#set-default-region-zone-environment-variables) environment variable to `europe-west6-a`.
```
export CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE=europe-west6a
```

* Obtain the name of the [Artifact Registry container image repository](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/artifacts/repositories/list) that has been provisioned in the environment. This repository will be used to store the container images of the application.

```
export REPO_NAME=$(gcloud artifacts repositories list --location=$CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION --format="value(name)")
```

* Set up [Artifact Registry authentication for Docker](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication#gcloud-helper)
```
gcloud auth configure-docker $CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION-docker.pkg.dev
```

* Obtain credentials for GKE cluster.
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials gke-otel-blueprints --region $CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION
```

* Position yourself in the lab folder.
```
cd ~/gke-observability-workshop/lab-01/app
```

* Point the [*SKAFFOLD_DEFAULT_REPO*](https://skaffold.dev/docs/environment/image-registries/#:~:text=default%2Drepo%20%3Cmyrepo%3E-,SKAFFOLD_DEFAULT_REPO,-environment%20variable) environment variable to the Artifact Registry repository.
```
$ export SKAFFOLD_DEFAULT_REPO=$CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT/$REPO_NAME
```

* If you just want to [build and push](https://skaffold.dev/docs/builders/builder-types/docker/) the containers to the Artifact Registry repository use.
```
skaffold build
```

* If you want to build and push the containers to the Artifact Registry repository and also [deploy the application](https://skaffold.dev/docs/deployers/kubectl/) to the GKE cluster use.
```
kubectl create ns blueprints
skaffold run
```
